## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🎵 [FullCircle](https://github.com/lnsomniak/full-circle) - Intelligent Music Discovery Engine
> ML powered personalized music recommendation system that understands your taste

**The Problem:** Spotify's recommendations are trained on everybody. FullCircle learns *your* specific taste - the energy you look for, the moods you gravitate toward, how you jump between completely different genres.

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 XGBoost ML model with TF-IDF for prediction confidence (85% accuracy)
- 🎯 Weighted similarity using rare tag IDF scores
- 📊 Cosine similarity calculations for artist matching
- 🔮 Explore Mode - Hides artists you already know for pure discovery
- 💡 Explainable AI - See WHY each artist was recommended
- 👍👎 Feedback collection system for model retraining
- 🎨 Personalized loading screen with your album artwork

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Spotify Web API, Last.fm API
- **ML/Data:** XGBoost, TF-IDF, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment:** Vercel + Render

**Live Demo:** https://full-circle-theta.vercel.app

### 🏙️ [ForkTheCity](https://github.com/ForkTheCity) - Open Source Civic Infrastructure
> Empowering communities to solve local problems through forkable civic networking tools

**The Vision:** Modern cities have resources but lack coordination. ForkTheCity provides communities with modular, scalable tools to organize, fund, and execute projects that actually matter.

**Tech Stack:** Python, React, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL  
**Impact:** MIT licensed platform enabling communities to fork and customize civic infrastructure

### 🔧 [IEEE@UH Inventory System](https://github.com/lnsomniak/IEEE-UH-Inventory-System) - Smart Inventory Management
> ML powered tracking system reducing equipment shortages for 100+ student engineers

Building a fullstack inventory management platform that:
- 🤖 Predicts hardware needs based on upcoming events using machine learning
- 📊 Optimizes $10K+ annual budget allocation
- 📦 Tracks 500+ electronic components with location mapping
- ⚡ Reduces equipment shortages by 60%

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, Scikit-learn  
**Real world impact:** Developed for University of Houston IEEE student chapter

### 🧠 [SSMLA](https://github.com/lnsomniak/SSMLA) - Self-Sufficient-Machine-Learning-Assisant
> Custom coding assistant built with Microsoft Phi-3, trained on personal coding style. An AI to teach me how to better create and cultivate the AI market.

**What makes it special:**
- Fine tuned Microsoft Phi-3 Mini (3.8B parameters) using LoRA
- Trained on 2000+ examples of my code, explanations, and problem solving approach
- Responds with detailed, "dumbed down" explanations matching my learning style
- Integrated with IEEE inventory system for demand prediction

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, Microsoft Phi-3, Docker, ROCm (AMD GPU)  
**Strategy:** Demonstrates ML engineering skills and Microsoft ecosystem experience
